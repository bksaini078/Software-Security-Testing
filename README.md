# Software-Security-Testing

A lot of research has been done recently towards creating
effective approaches to increase the security testing scope and effectiveness. Software security testing is a key aspect to ensure reliability, confidence, and trust in software applications. Secure software can contribute
to the software quality and plays a vital role in reducing the risk of intentional/unintentional cyber attacks or failures that can severely affect the
reputation of a software company and can lead to negative consequences.
This paper discusses the importance of security testing, challenges in
implementing testing techniques, and unique testing approaches in the
software development life cycle. With the day by day advancement of
technology, the frequency of cyber attacks are increasing and the nature
of cyber attacks are becoming more complex. This paper presents the
widely used testing techniques and also respective tools. Finally, a brief
explanation about the important prerequisite for designing effective security test sequences and increasing testing scope in secure software testing:
mindset.
